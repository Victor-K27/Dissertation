"The Impact of Somatic and Germline Variation in Cancer Cell Quiescence"

Here you can find the code used in this project. 

There are 6 files for the different aspects of this dissertation project. The purpose of each file is explained bellow. Specific comments can be found in the code of each file. The packages required for each file are writtent at the top of each file. 

# 141 genes eQTL analysis
This code was used to carry out the analysis of the eQTLs for the 141 quiescence-associated genes. We investigated the number of eQTLs that signififcantly control the expression of the quiescence-associated genes and whether any genes are found under the control of the same eQTL.

# Somatic mutation analysis
This code was used to invesstigate whether any of the eQTLs were reported in cancer patients as somatic mutations. Additionally, this code was used to carry out a pan-cancer and a cancer-specific somatic mutation analysis between quiescent and fast cycling tumours and identify enrichments of mutations in genes in either group. 

# BRCA1/2 mutations and quiescence
This code was used to investigate the effect of BRCA1/2 mutations on quiescece in breast cancer. 

# Homologous repair deficiency
This code was used to investigate the effect of HRD on quiescence in breast cancer. 

# Large segment CNA analysis
This code was used to carry out a cancer-specific analysis of the difference in copy number alterations between quiescent and fast cycling tumours, after classifiying CNA in large segments. 

# Chromosome aberrations analysis
This code was used to carry out a pan-cancer and a cancer-specific analysis of chromosome arm aberrations between quiescent and fast cycling tumours. 

Please note that the data files required for each analysis will be added on GitHub soon. 

Thank you for reading! :)
